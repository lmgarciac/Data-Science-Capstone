This data will be collected from the **Statistical Atlas** website, manually or by web-scraping: [Statistical Atlas](https://statisticalatlas.com/place/Florida/Orlando/Household-Income)\n\nAlso, the location of each neighborhood will be gathered using the **Geopy** library.\n\nFinally, the **Foursquare API** will be used to obtain a list of different venue types (such as Fast food Restaurants, Parks or beauty salons). This will be achieved using the different **Categories** that Foursquare defines for each type of Venue:\nhttps://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories\n\nThe features that will be used from each dataset are:\n\n#### Statistical Atlas:\n\n* List of **Neighborhoods** of each chosen City *(Example: Belltown, Boston)*\n* **Population** of each Neighborhood *(Example: 120.000 inhabitants)*\n* **Average income** of each Neighborhood *(Example: 65.000 USD)*\n\n#### Geopy:\n\n* **Latitude and Longitude** of each Neighborhood *(Example: -71.03 / 42.12)*\n\n#### Foursquare API:\n\n* Venue **Name** *(Example: McDonalds)*\n* Venue **Location** (latitude and longitude) *(Example: -71.12 / 42.22)*\n* Venue **Category** *(Example: Fast-Food Restaurant)*"
